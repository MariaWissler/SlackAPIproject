# SlackAPIproject
To practice working with APIs, we will utilize the API for a tool with which you already very familiar: Slack!

A little bit about our learning Goals:
- Sending requests to and receiving responses from an API
- Working with data from an external source
- Mocking an external dependency during testing
- Designing and implementing a program using inheritance
- and writting our own test !
